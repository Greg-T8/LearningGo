## Overview and History of Go

<summary>Overview and History of Go</summary>

- **Conception**: Go was conceived in 2007 by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson at Google and was publicly announced in 2009.

- **Influencers of Go**:

  - **C**: Syntax, control structures, basic data types, call-by-value parameter passing, pointers, and emphasis on compiling to machine code.
  - **Modula-2**: Inspired the package concept.
  - **Oberon**: Eliminated the distinction between module interface files and module implementation files.
  - **Oberon-2**: Influenced syntax for packages and declarations, particularly method declarations.
  - **CSP (Communicating Sequential Processes)**: Influenced goroutines and channels.
  - **Squeak**: Provided handling for mouse and keyboard events, with statically created channels.
  - **Newsqueak**: A purely functional language with garbage collection, aimed at managing keyboard, mouse, and window events.
  - **Alef**: Attempted to make Newsqueak a viable system programming language, but its lack of garbage collection made concurrency too painful.

### The Go Project

- **Motivation**: The Go project was born out of frustration with several software systems at Google that were suffering from an explosion of complexity.
- **Components**:
  - The language itself.
  - Its tools and standard libraries.
  - A cultural agenda of radical simplicity.
- **Features**:
  - Garbage collection.
  - A package system.
  - First-class functions.
  - Lexical scope.
  - A system call interface.
  - Immutable strings.
- **Minimalism**:
  - Go has comparatively few features and is unlikely to add more.
  - **Notable omissions**:
    - No implicit numeric conversions.
    - No constructors or destructors.
    - No operator overloading.
    - No default parameter values.
    - No inheritance.
    - No generics.
    - No exceptions.
    - No macros.
    - No function annotations.
    - No thread-local storage.
